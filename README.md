This project showcases a Visual Analytics Tool designed to facilitate comprehensive data analysis through advanced visualization techniques. Utilizing React and D3.js, the application supports dynamic, interactive charts such as scatter plots, line charts, histograms, and more to efficiently handle and visualize large datasets. Key to this project is the integration of various sampling methods—random, stratified, and systematic—which enhance data representation accuracy while optimizing performance. These techniques allow for a detailed yet concise summary view of complex data structures, making the tool particularly valuable for data-intensive scenarios. This work not only highlights my technical skills in developing high-performance web applications but also my ability to innovate in data visualization for effective decision-making support.
